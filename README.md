# Scavenger2D
Scavenger2D - JS version
Based on graphic assets and game design from Unity's "2D Roguelike tutorial"
https://unity3d.com/es/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial
The Unity's version has a 30Mb size, while I'm trying to pack it into 13K.
In any case, those 14 video Unity tutorials are great ;)
